# Work in progress: Diversity in Gesta

Gesta is a leading peer-reviewed academic journal in the area of medieval art.

Target functionality: Generate visualizations of trends in gender and region of origin of Gesta-published authors.

Current functionality: Maps locations of institutions with which Gesta-published authors are affiliated.

*Note:* Script can easily be generalized to other journals via commandline; Gesta is the motivating example and set as default.

### use in terminal:
<!--- Make code --->

  `-h`, `--help`            show this help message and exit

  `-v`, `--verbose`         include to print progress messages

  `-n JOURNAL_NAME`, `--journal_name JOURNAL_NAME`
                        name of journal or source to search for

  `-i ID`, `--journal_id ID`
                        OpenAlex id of journal to analyze - defaults to Gesta if unspecified

## To-Do

-  make protocol for what fields to query to get locations if they don't have the coordinates?
    ie get institution ID, else get institution name and country, else get author name and country and year?
- look into Genderize API to get gender stats
- look into reconstructing abstracts from one-hot encoding
- swap print statements for progress bar
